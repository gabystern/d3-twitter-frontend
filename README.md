> Visualize patterns in how the world is talking. <br>

Twending is an data visualization tool that enables users to search tweets by hashtag and create a variety of interactive graphs to map the prevalence/impact of a hashtag over a period of time as well as an average sentiment towards that hashtag. Twending has a React frontend with graphs built using D3.js and a <a href="https://github.com/gabystern/d3-twitter-backend">Rails backend</a>.
